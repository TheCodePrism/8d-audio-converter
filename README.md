## Development

You can start editing the application by modifying the files in the `app` directory. The application auto-updates as you edit the files.

Key files:
- `app/page.tsx` - Main page component
- `components/AudioConverter.tsx` - Core conversion logic
- `components/AudioPlayer.tsx` - Custom audio player
- `components/UploadForm.tsx` - File upload handling

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a custom font family from Vercel.

## Deployment

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme).
